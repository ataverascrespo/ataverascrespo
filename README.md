# Hey, I'm Alex ðŸ‘‹ 
I'm a dedicated Software Developer and problem solver. I'm deeply involved in refining my skills and exploring new technologies. Right now I'm consistently working with languages such as Java, C#, Python, TypeScript and Bash.

I'm also diving deep into the world of infrastructure, working with Azure DevOps to develop and maintain CI/CD pipelines in my current role, as well as in my free time with Docker, AWS, and GCP. But beyond coding and learning, I love to collect records and listen to music. 

I'm constantly seeking opportunities to learn and collaborate on exciting projects.
