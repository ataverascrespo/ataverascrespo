# Welcome to my Github!

## About Me
Hey, I'm Alex ðŸ‘‹. I recently graduated Trent University with a B.Sc in Computer Science and a Software Engineering specialization, and I currently work as a Software Developer at Daystar Limited! In my free time, I enjoy collecting vinyl records, listening to music and chilling with my cat. I am always looking for opportunities to learn and improve my skills.

## Projects
Here are some of the projects that I have worked on recently:

#### **OMG Mobile** 
- A cross-platform, modern mobile app made for my Software Engineering Project course at Trent University. 
- (*OMG Mobile's deployment is currently in progress*)

#### **Record Rack** 
- A full-stack application that allows users to create a collection of their favourite albums in a digitized vinyl record display.

#### **Computer Graphics Minecraft Sim Project**
- A Unity game that implements Perlin Noise algorithm, which allow the user to generate and manipulate a Minecraft-style terrain with mountains, valleys, and water bodies.
- You can play my Unity Minecraft demo [here!](https://ataverascrespo.itch.io/minecraft-perlin-noise)
