# Hey, I'm Alex ðŸ‘‹ 
### Senior Software Developer @ Nasdaq

Dedicated software developer and problem solver and always refining my skills or exploring new technologies. My most frequently used technologies include **Java, C#, Python, TypeScript, Shell scripts, Scala, SQL, Docker, AWS, GCP and Git.**

In my career I've worked in fields such as enterprise app development, DevOps/infrastructure-focused development, and currently, data engineering and integration with Nasdaq. But beyond coding and learning, I love to collect records, listen to music and go to concerts.

I'm constantly seeking opportunities to learn and collaborate on exciting projects!
